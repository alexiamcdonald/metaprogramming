Talk about yourself.

Alexia is doing her talk on Metaprogramming in Ruby and she wants to show everyone how easy it is. She read this amazing book by Paolo Perrotta called Metaprogramming Ruby 2: Program like the Ruby Pros.

She decides that she is going to drag her friend Candy Goodison into her talk because she believes their needs to be more women doing technical talks at
meetups in order to provide good role models for the Ruby community. Yay! Let's smash the Patriarchy with women and Pokemon!

Candy has been working at Red Bubble for 7 months and has heard all about metaprogramming from Alexia.

Candy talks about herself and then says.

Candy - "Metaprogramming seems intimidating, Alexia. I'm not sure I could do it"

Alexia - "Candy, Metaprogramming is just misunderstood. I'll show you but first I need to explain a few things."

Go to what is metaprogramming slide.

Candy - "Whoa that sure sounds super powerful! What do you mean when you say you can open up classes and override methods?"

Alexia - "Well it's simple! Have you ever ran into ` undefined method ... for nil:NilClass`?

Candy- "Yeah it's really annoying!"

Alexia - "Well you can totally override the Nil Class and tell it to fuck off!"

Candy - "Omg that's awesome. I wanna try that."

Alexia - "No Candy! You can't do that. That would be bad. That's called Monkey Patching and your team at Red Bubble would totally hate your guts if you did it."

Candy - "Ohhh wow so that's what Monkey Patching is!"

Alexia - "Yup! But I'll show you how you can override classes because it's super important to understand if you wanna be better programmer."

Show opening up classes slide

Take string for example
You want to add a Censor method to string so you can make strings more PC. Kinda like Slackbot!

Candy - "I see a lot of people get upset by that slackbot being PC but I think it's the right thing to do if wanna make this community more diverse.
Can I write this method?"

Alexia - "That's super PC! Well done. You opened up a Class. I'll show you how to override a method so you can be a bad programmer."

Candy - "Yeah I can now see why monkey patching is bad and I shouldn't do it. So where is metaprogramming used?"

Show where metaprogramming is used in ruby.

Alexia - "I think it's time we got more advanced. Let's talk about the eigen class. It's also known as the singleton class."

Eigen class slide

Candy - "That class kinda sounds like you. One of a kind and single."

Alexia - "Yeahh... Well more about Eigen classes"

Candy - "I want more pair programming! I used find_by all the time at work. You mentioned at Rails Camp that's it's metaprogramming. How?"

Show find by example

Alexia - "It took me a really long time to follow the chain to figure it out. This is one of the problems with metaprogramming. It's really hard to debug on the implementation side"

Candy - "But it's really easy to read on the call side and I like it because of that!"

Alexia - "Yeah there are a bunch of different ways it's awesome *show pros* but it's also can be bad like we saw with monkey patching and debugging"

Candy - "I think you're right about it not being special though. You just need to read the code to get better at it. Plus I totally do metaprogramming already at work and I didn't even know it till now. It's not that special."
