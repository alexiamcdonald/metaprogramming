## Why it's not special

- Pretty much this book was about how to read code (great book by the way)
- We all do it already (even if you don't know you do you totes do because it's everywhere in rails)
- The whole concept is "you can write better code by understanding what the hell you are doing but we will call it a fancy name because we want to be fancy" *insert picture of target superstore*
