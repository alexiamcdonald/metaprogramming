# Metaprogramming
#### There is nothing special about metaprogramming

- Metapod

## What is metaprogramming?

It's code that writes

## Why it's not special

- Pretty much this book was about how to read code (great book by the way)
- We all do it already (even if you don't know you do you totes do because it's everywhere in rails)
- The whole concept is "you can write better code by understanding what the hell you are doing but we will call it a fancy name because we want to be fancy" *insert picture of target superstore*

## Pros

- Rake
- Rails generate*
- Code is easier to read (on caller side)
- Less code in general

** Senior devs will probably call me out here but you know I'm right because it totally writes code ðŸ˜…

## Cons

- Monkeypatching
- Debugging (Method missing)
- Hard to read on implementation side

## Singleton Class

- There is only one single instance (neo matrix)
- It's single like me
- The design pattern

## ActiveRecord find_by

- rails 1 show example of how fucked up this method missing example is

## How awesome is metaprogramming

- I could potentially monkey patch away nil class so I don't have to do nil checking all the time
